## 💡 Inspiration & Credits

This project was inspired by and built upon the amazing tutorial by [Codesistency](https://www.youtube.com/@codesistency) on YouTube:
🎥 [Real-Time Chat App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuwigEmwsTM&t=2s)

> I followed along with the backend tutorial and used their GitHub repository as a reference when needed. While much of the backend logic is aligned with the tutorial, I made UI and UX improvements with the help of AI tools like Cursor and Claude to enhance the frontend experience.

Big thanks to **Codesistency** for the in-depth explanation and clean structure!
